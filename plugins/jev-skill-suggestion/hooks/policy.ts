/**
 * jev-skill-suggestion — pure decision logic.
 *
 * No `$` and no I/O here: this module reads the engine's skill listing, builds
 * the two requests the decision API takes, reads their answers, and turns them
 * into at most one skill name and the text that suggests it. The hooks module
 * does every call on `$` at its own call site.
 *
 * The shape follows TypeSafe's "Skill suggestion" cookbook
 * (https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/skill_suggestion):
 *
 *   request 1  rank every skill (`which`, a Choice with each skill's one-line
 *              description as its criterion) and ask three Nouls about the
 *              request itself — whether it wants an action taken rather than
 *              an explanation given. Their mean is the gate.
 *   request 2  re-read the top few (`which` again, now with each skill's full
 *              description and the opening of its SKILL.md) and ask one Noul
 *              per candidate: does this skill do the specific thing asked?
 *              Every `fits` may come back low, and then nothing is suggested.
 *
 * Two backends speak to the same model with different wire shapes:
 *
 *   typesafe  POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone
 *             `{ model, state, questions }`; a yes/no question is a `noul`
 *             and every answer carries its own `confidence`.
 *   gateway   POST https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v4/ai/evaluation-model
 *             `{ state, questions }` with the model in a header; a yes/no
 *             question is a `boolean` answered as `probability`.
 *
 * The Gateway shape is not documented publicly; it was read from
 * @ai-sdk/gateway and @ai-sdk/provider.
